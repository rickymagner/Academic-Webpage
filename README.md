# Academic-Webpage
HTML/CSS/Javascript files for my academic webpage, currently hosted [here](https://math.bu.edu/people/rmagner/). To see a Javascript demo of the Central Limit Theorem, check [here](https://math.bu.edu/people/rmagner/CLTdemo.html). You can use the statplots.js file for inspiration in creating your own interactive demos for teaching.
